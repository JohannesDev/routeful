# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Routeful is currently in the initial stages of development and has not released any official versions. As such, there are no active versions of the project being supported with security updates at this time. This policy will be updated following the release of Routeful's first official version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to maintaining the security of our project. Given that Routeful is still in development, specific procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities are being established. We encourage contributors and users to check back for updates on this policy as the project evolves.

Thank you for your understanding and support in keeping Routeful secure.
